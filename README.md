one done nine more, unless this works too... then it'll be eight
THREEgit push!
FOUR not sure why git push became part of three...
FIVE well that worked, must be doing something right...
SIX THAT ONE WAS SP FATS
SEVEN too fast, got overconfident
EIGHT I never learned how to type, not sure how I managed to skip that class in jr high... but I'm a dang fast hunt n pecker
NINE did I just discover that the arrow keys let me add previously entered prompts???
